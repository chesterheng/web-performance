### Thinking About Performance

#### Why does performance matter?

0.1 second is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is reacting instantaneously, meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result. ‚ÄîJakob Nielsen

1.0 second is about the limit for the user's flow of thought to stay uninterrupted, even though the user will notice the delay. Normally, no special feedback is necessary during delays of more than 0.1 but less than 1.0 second, but the user does lose the feeling of operating directly on the data. ‚ÄîJakob Nielsen

10 seconds is about the limit for keeping the user's attention focused on the dialogue. For longer delays, users will want to perform other tasks while waiting for the computer to finish, so they should be given feedback indicating when the computer expects to be done. Feedback during the delay is especially important if the response time is likely to be highly variable, since users will then

If your user interface takes 10 seconds or more to respond to an interaction, then we should talk.

Aberdeen Group found that a 1 second slow down resulted 11% fewer page views, 7% less conversion.

[Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/news/press/2017-press/akamai-releases-spring-2017-state-of-online-retail-performance-report.jsp) found that two-second delay in web page load time increase bounce rates by 103 percent.

A 400 millisecond improvement in performance resulted in a 9% increase in traffic at [Yahoo](https://www.slideshare.net/stoyan/dont-make-me-wait-or-building-highperformance-web-applications#btnNext).

[Google](http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/29/Keynote%20Presentation%202.pdf) found that a 2% slower page resulted in 2% fewer searches, which means 2% fewer ads shown.

100 millisecond improvement in performance results in 1% increase in overall revenue at [Amazon](http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/08/radar-theme-web-ops.html).

[53% of users will leave a mobile site if it takes more than 3 secs to load.](https://gs.statcounter.com/press/mobile-and-tablet-internet-usage-exceeds-desktop-for-first-time-worldwide)

According to [research](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/09/why-performance-matters-the-perception-of-time/#the-need-for-performance-optimization-the-20-rule), if you want user to feel like your site is faster than your competitors, you need to be 20% faster.

#### What is performance?

There are different kinds of performance.
- Network Load performance
- Parsing and JavaScript and Compilation performance
- Rendering performance

Some numbers to think about.

Disclaimer: We‚Äôre not going to obsess over numbers.

It‚Äôs about getting 10% better.

‚ÄúStrategies for Optimizing Web Performance When, Honestly, You Have Like 5 Meetings Today and You Need to Choose the Correct Hills Upon Which to Strategically Die‚Äù ‚Äî Romeeka Gayhart, @CCandUC

Are all of our needs the same?
What matters to you?

- The New York Times might care about time to first headline.
- Twitter might care about time to first tweet. 
- Chrome might care about time to inspect element. 
- What does your product or project care about?

### The Importance of Measurement

Measure. Don‚Äôt tune for speed until you‚Äôve measured, and even then don‚Äôt unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest. ‚ÄîRob Pike

Do not go just blindly applying performance optimizations.

There is a cost to every abstraction ‚Äîand everything has a trade off.

I‚Äôm not a fan of premature optimization, but performance is one of those things where if we‚Äôre not keeping an eye on it, it has a chance of getting away from us.

Some things to think about while measuring

- Are we testing performance on fancy MacBook Pros or consumer-grade hardware?
- Are we simulating less-than-perfect network conditions. 
- What is our performance budget?

Don‚Äôt get carried away with measuring, either.

Thinking deeply about the architecture and design of your application is a better use of your time than micro-benchmarks.

Three Tiers of Advice

- Definitely do this.
- Maybe do this, but measure before and after.
- Only do this if you find a performance problem that needs solving.

And now: Steve‚Äôs Golden Rule of Performance

- Doing Less Stuff Takes Less Time.
- If you can do it later. Do it later.

Rough Outline

- JavaScript performance: Write code that runs faster, later, or not at all.
- Rendering performance: It turns out most of our JavaScript happens in the browser, which has its own performance concerns.
- Load performance: Until the user actually gets the page, there isn‚Äôt much to optimize.

## **02. JavaScript Performance**

### The Cost of JavaScript

Problem: You literally can‚Äôt buy faster servers to improve performance of client-side applications.

I mean, you could buy all of your customers faster computers, I guess.ü§ë

A lot of time and energy is spent compressing assets, removing requests, and reducing latency, but what about once the application is running?

[JavaScript Bytes](https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-javascript#bytesJs)

Sometimes, scripting (parsing and compiling) is the real culprit.

Okay, so how does JavaScript even work?

Fun fact: JavaScript is a compiled language.

Most browsers use something called just-in-time (JIT) compilation.

Things to know about JIT compilation

- It means that there is compilation step.
- It means that it happens moments before execution. 
- That means it happens on our client‚Äôs machine.
- That means they‚Äôre paying the cost and/or doing the hard work for us.

Let‚Äôs look at your code‚Äôs journey through V8 at a high level.

### Parsing

The source code is the true intention of the application, but the engine needs to figure out what this means.

Parsing can be slow. As slow as 1MB/s on mobile.

One way to reduce parsing time is to have less code to parse.

Another way is to do as much parsing as you need and as little as you can get away with.

Parsing happens in two phases

- Eager (full parse): This is what you think of when you think about parsing.
- Lazy (pre-parse): Do the bear minimum now. We‚Äôll parse it for realsies later.

Generally speaking, Lazy Parsing is a good thing.

Doing less work is faster than doing work, right?

The basic rules

- Scan through the top-level scope. Parse all the code you see that‚Äôs actually doing something.
- Skip things like function declarations and classes for now. We‚Äôll parse them when we need them.

This could bite you. But, how?

```javascript
// These will be eagerly-parsed.
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
// Take note that there a function here,
// but, we'll parse the body when we need it.
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
add(a, b);   // Whoa. Go back and parse add()!
```

Do you see the problem here?

Corollary: Doing stuff twice is slower than doing it once.

```javascript
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
// Parse it now!
(function add(a, b) {
return a + b;
});
add(a, b);
```

It‚Äôs definitely helpful to know how this works, but...

micro-optimization (noun): Thing you read about one time and you know pester your co-works about in code reviews, even though it has an almost unnoticeable impact at scale.

‚ÄúBut, Steve! These little things add up!‚Äù ‚Äî Me (pretending to be you), just now.
